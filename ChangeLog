May 1 2003
	- Released 0.7.0.

Apr 20 2003
	- Brought back the -c flag with changed behavior to
	  fit the new modular input plugin design.
	- Applied (modified) patch sent by Nigel Roberts
	  implementing the <autobrightness> feature. Credits
	  also go to Stefan Meyer for the original code from
	  wwwcam.

Mar 9 2003
	- Http requests can now take a query string, which will
	  be ignored when looking for a matching config vpath.
	- Fixed ftp uploading for ftpds which give multi-line
	  replies in a certain format.
	- Support basic http authentication.

Feb 15 2003
	- Added experimental xwd (x11 screen shot) input plugin.

Jan 26 2003
	- Modularized the video input code, removed camdev.* files.
	  Their functionality was moved to libinput_v4l. The
	  '-c' command line switch doesn't work now. Will fix.
	- Libfilewrite and libftpup now have the capability of
	  timestamping filenames.

Jan 23 2003
	- Applied patch by Jaco Greeff to give libftpup a better
	  sleep time precision, compensating for long upload times.

Jan 20 2003
	- Changed the '~' filename postfix to '.tmp' in libfilewrite
	  and libftpup.

Jan 18 2003
	- Added scripts/camsource2bmp.pl example script.
	- Added the smallest filter ever: color inverting.
	- Implemented -r and -s/-k command line switches to restart
	  and shut down camsource.

Jan 16 2003
	- Reworked _private handling a bit. Avoid repeated parsing
	  or large xml trees.
	- Simplyfied per-instance filter storage to make use of
	  libxml's _private struct member.

Jan 15 2003
	- Added <cmd> option to camdev section to support external
	  trigger for capture on/off events.

Jan 14 2003
	- The http module can now server raw image data, plus it now
	  supports 'connection: keep-alive'. Combining those two
	  features, it is possible for third-party processes to
	  access the video data.
	- Fixed old jpeg compression crash bug
	- Added capability of handling multiple input v4l devices
	  at the same time.

Jan 5 2003
	- Added motiondetect custom config. Filter works better
	  now too.
	- Added regrab filter.
	- Added per-instance context storage for filters.
	- Modified a few filters to make use of the new per-
	  instance storage space to save a bit cpu (?)

Jan 4 2003
	- Added a preliminary motiondetect filter. More to do.
	- Changed the filter handling a bit, to make it possble
	  to have filters which "swallow" the image.
	- Added vloopback module, courtesy of Cyril Rocheteau.
	- Tried to make up some login to autodetect whether overlay
	  is supported, and gracefully ignore it if it isn't. Same
	  goes for unsupported fps settings (e.g. bttv).

Dec 31 2002
	- Included patch sent by Cyril Rocheteau to allow camsource
	  to work with drivers which don't support overlay
	  capturing (e.g. meye).
